        /*  Type casting is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another.
    There are two main types of type casting in Java:
    1.Implicit Casting (Widening Conversion): Automatically performed by the Java compiler
    when converting a smaller data type to a larger data type
    Safe and does not lead to data loss.
    (e.g., byte to int, int to float).
    2.Explicit Casting (Narrowing Conversion): Needs to be explicitly performed
    by the programmer when converting a larger data type to a smaller data type
    (e.g., int to byte, float to int).
    This can potentially lead to data loss.
